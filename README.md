# Abstract
The project aims to investigate the relationship between the strictness level of protection of elderly people policy(PE Policy) and population-level Covid-19 mortality rate(p-mortality rate) from October 1st 2020 to January 31st 2021 for 20 European countries and United Kingdom, and figure out whether it is causal relation based on WHO COVID-19 data and Protection of elderly people policy data. First, descriptive analysis will be conducted to show time series plot of new cases and new deaths in the world and in different WHO regions, and geographic plot of new deaths in the world map over time. Second, in inferential analysis, a three-way ANOVA model will be used to explore relation between the strictness level of PE policy and p-mortality rate and we find that there is a relationship between strictness level of PE policy and p-mortality rate. Also, we use Tukey Kramer method for pairwise comparison and we find that at the significance level of 0.05, the mean p-mortality rate of level-2 PE policy is significantly lower than that of level-1 PE policy. Last, in sensitivity analysis, model assumptions are checked by diagnostic plots.
